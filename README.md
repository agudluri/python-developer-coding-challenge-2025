# Python Developer Hiring Challenge

Welcome! This repository gives you everything you need to decide if the role fits your skills and to complete the technical exercise.

## How to Navigate
- Review the [job description](docs/job-description.md) to understand the team, responsibilities, and skills we value.
- Read the [coding challenge brief](docs/challenge.md) for detailed requirements, deliverables, and evaluation criteria.
- Fork or copy this template into your own private workspace when you are ready to begin the challenge.
- Share your solution with us following the submission guidance at the end of the challenge brief.

## Cloud Flexibility
Azure examples are provided, but you are welcome to complete the challenge using AWS, GCP, or another cloud. If you choose a different provider, deliver equivalent infrastructure, automation, and documentation so reviewers can reproduce your solution end-to-end.

## Repository Structure
- `docs/job-description.md` — role overview and qualifications.
- `docs/challenge.md` — challenge specification, deliverables, and submission checklist.

We recommend reviewing both documents before you start coding. If questions come up, reach out to your recruiting contact so we can clarify expectations quickly.
